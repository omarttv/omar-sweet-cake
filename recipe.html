<h1>Baking Instruction</h1>
<li>Preheat oven to 350°F/180°. Grease an 8×8-inch pan</li>
<li>In a large bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Mix in coconut. Set aside.</li>

<li>In another medium bowl, whisk eggs and sugar until well combined. Add coconut cream, oil, and vanilla extract, and whisk until combined. Add egg mixture into flour mixture and fold with a rubber spatula just until combined. Do not overmix—the less you mix, the lighter the cake will be.</li>

<li>Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow cake to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>

<li>To make the chocolate ganache: place chocolate and coconut cream in a medium heat-proof bowl, and microwave in 20-30 second-intervals, stirring in between each interval, until melted. Alternatively, set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, stirring occasionally, until melted. Pour ganache evenly over the cake.</li>
 

<li>Refrigerate for 1 hour until the ganache is set.
Cake can be kept in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</li>
